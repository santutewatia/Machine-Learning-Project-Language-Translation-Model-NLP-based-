# Machine-Learning-Project-Language-Translation-Model-NLP-based

Project Summary:

This project focuses on building a language translation model inspired by popular tools like Google Translate and ChatGPT. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning, the model translates text from one language to another.

The process involves:

Data Preparation: Uploading and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and converting data types for consistency.

Feature Extraction: Applying CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical features suitable for machine learning.

Model Training: Using the Naive Bayes algorithm to train the translation model on processed data.

Evaluation: Measuring model accuracy and other metrics to assess performance.

Real-Time Testing: Simulating live translations similar to real-world applications, demonstrating the modelâ€™s practical utility.

The project leverages key Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to build a complete end-to-end machine learning pipeline from raw data to deployment-ready model.

This hands-on project enhances skills in NLP, ML model development, data preprocessing, and real-time application testing, making it a strong showcase for roles in data science, machine learning engineering, and natural language processing.
